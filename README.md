Every process involves gaining knowledge and comprehension. It provides an individual not just tools to fight, but to know what to fight for. Scenarios might vary at times, sometimes leading to agreements and other times into disagreements. A Sovereign Individual understands that every human being develops their own understanding and beliefs. And libery is sovereignty of the individual. It is not given but taken and defended. A sovereign individual takes responsibility of their actions and beliefs, rather than putting it onto societal judgement. Knowledge is like air and shouldn't be denied to anyone. Knowledge gives the individual power to develop ideas, and ideas are bulletproof.
